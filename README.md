# Crazy 8 Grappling Club

Welcome to the official repository for the **Crazy 8 Grappling Club** website.

The website is currently under development, and features are being added as I research and decide on the best solutions moving forward.

The goal is to showcase the club's activities, events, and information about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training sessions. Itâ€™s built using React + Vite with a focus on a responsive and user-friendly design.

## About

The Crazy 8 Grappling Club website serves as a digital hub for members, instructors, and enthusiasts of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It provides information about training schedules, club events, instructor profiles, and a gallery of past events. The website also allows users to contact the club and stay updated with the latest news.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Dynamic Navigation:** Intuitive navigation with smooth page transitions.
- **Event Listings:** Display upcoming training sessions and events.
- **Instructor Profiles:** Information about the instructors and their experience.
- **Contact Form:** Reach out to the club for inquiries or registration.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React/Vite, Tailwind CSS (soon to be implemented)
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Tools:** Figma (for design specifications), Git, GitHub

## To-Do List

- Implement a headless CMS so the instructor can easily make updates.
- Continue building out the CSS and eventually transition to MUI or Tailwind CSS.
- Add content such as photos and videos. High-resolution photos from a training seminar need to be converted to smaller resolutions/formats for use on the site.
